# SMS Bridge Consolidator

This software is an SMS Bridge Consolidator that works on a laptop connected to various older mobile devices on the same local Wi-Fi network.

## Project Structure

This project now provides two deployment options:

### üìÅ ansible-docker/
Docker-based deployment using `community.docker` Ansible collection
- Simple container orchestration
- Good for development and testing
- See [ansible-docker/README.md](ansible-docker/README.md) for details

### üìÅ ansible-k3s/
Kubernetes-based deployment using K3s and `kubernetes.core` Ansible collection
- Production-ready orchestration
- Built-in monitoring and scaling
- See [ansible-k3s/README.md](ansible-k3s/README.md) for details

### üìÅ Shared Files
- `vault.yml` - Encrypted secrets (create from `docs/example_vault.yml`)
- `schema.sql` - Database schema
- `sms_server.py` - Main SMS processing application
- `checks/` - Validation modules
- `docs/` - Documentation and examples
- `tests/` - Testing utilities and sample data

## Concept

The idea is that older mobiles act as SMS receivers and the laptop aggregates all received SMSes in a PostgreSQL database. Duplicate SMSes are filtered and only unique SMS numbers are forwarded to the cloud database (example uses Cloudflare D1).

This method can verify mobile numbers that have been written to Cloudflare D1 via IP input. Users can send SMS to older mobile numbers to confirm their mobile numbers after submitting an onboarding application via IP/Ethernet network.

## Deployment Options

This project offers two deployment methods with separate folder organization:

### üì¶ Docker Deployment (`ansible-docker/`)
- **Traditional approach** using community.docker collection
- **Single command deployment** with vault password
- **Lightweight** and familiar for Docker users
- Uses individual containers with custom networks

### ‚ò∏Ô∏è K3s Deployment (`ansible-k3s/`)  
- **Kubernetes approach** using lightweight K3s
- **Two-step deployment**: K3s install (sudo) + deployment (vault only)
- **Production-ready** with proper orchestration
- Uses Kubernetes manifests with deployments and services

Both methods deploy identical infrastructure with the same services and capabilities.

## Prerequisites

### Common Requirements for both Methods of Deployment
- Linux laptop (tested on Ubuntu/Debian) or WSL environment
- Ansible installed
- Git (for cloning)

### For Docker Deployment
- Docker and Docker Compose
- `community.docker` Ansible collection

### For K3s Deployment  
- `kubernetes.core` and `community.general` Ansible collections
   - This can be installed with `ansible-galaxy collection install kubernetes.core:1.2.1 community.general:3.8.1`
- Python kubernetes library (These are installed via install_k3s.yml)
- Docker or Buildah (for building container images)
   - Note: Docker can be installed with `sudo apt install docker.io`

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Deployment
```bash
cd ansible-docker
ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt setup_sms_bridge.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

### Option 2: K3s Deployment
```bash
# Step 1: Install K3s (one-time, requires sudo, run from project root, verbose output)
ansible-playbook -i ansible-k3s/inventory.txt ansible-k3s/install_k3s.yml --ask-become-pass -vvv

# Step 2: Deploy SMS Bridge (vault password only, run from project root, verbose output)
ansible-playbook -i ansible-k3s/inventory.txt ansible-k3s/setup_sms_bridge_k3s.yml --ask-vault-pass --ask-become-pass -vvv
```

## Setup Steps

1. **Create Vault File**: Copy and customize the vault file
   ```bash
   cp docs/example_vault.yml vault.yml
   ansible-vault encrypt vault.yml
   ```

2. **Choose Deployment Method**: Navigate to either `ansible-docker/` or `ansible-k3s/`

3. **Follow Method-Specific README**: Each folder has detailed instructions

4. **Verify**: Check that services are running and accessible

## Service Access

Both deployment methods provide access to:
- **SMS Receiver**: http://localhost:8080
- **Grafana Dashboard**: http://localhost:3001
- **Prometheus Metrics**: http://localhost:9090

## Mobile Setup Required

- Install SMS_Gateway app on older Android devices
- May require rooted device or developer mode
- Configure to send SMSes to laptop endpoint. This endpoint is noted in sms_server.py.

## Planned Updates

- Support for multiple mobile devices
- Enhanced filtering and validation
- Mobile app improvements
- Cloud backend integration enhancements

## Documentation

- [Best Practices](docs/best_practices.md)
- [Functionality Overview](docs/functionality.md)
- [Example Vault Configuration](docs/example_vault.yml)

## Testing

See the `tests/` directory for testing utilities and sample data.

## Migration

To switch between deployment methods:

1. Stop current deployment
2. Navigate to the other deployment folder
3. Run the setup playbook

Both methods use the same data directories and configuration.
