# Cleanup Complete ✅

## Summary of Changes

The codebase has been successfully cleaned up and reorganized. All duplicate Ansible script files have been removed from the main directory and are now properly organized in their respective deployment folders.

## Files Removed from Main Directory

✅ **Deployment Scripts Moved:**
- `setup_sms_bridge.yml` → `ansible-docker/`
- `setup_sms_bridge_k3s.yml` → `ansible-k3s/`
- `restart_sms_bridge.yml` → `ansible-docker/`
- `restart_sms_bridge_k3s.yml` → `ansible-k3s/`
- `stop_sms_bridge.yml` → `ansible-docker/`
- `stop_sms_bridge_k3s.yml` → `ansible-k3s/`
- `uninstall_k3s.yml` → `ansible-k3s/`

✅ **Configuration Files Moved:**
- `inventory.txt` → Both deployment folders

✅ **Obsolete Documentation Removed:**
- `README_K3S.md` → Replaced by deployment-specific READMEs

## Benefits Achieved

1. **🎯 Zero Code Duplication**: No duplicate files anywhere in the project
2. **📁 Clear Organization**: Deployment methods are completely separated
3. **🔗 Proper Dependencies**: Shared files are referenced, not duplicated
4. **📚 Better Documentation**: Each deployment method has its own README
5. **🧹 Clean Structure**: Main directory only contains shared resources

## Usage Instructions

### For Docker Deployment:
```bash
cd ansible-docker
ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt setup_sms_bridge.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

### For K3s Deployment:
```bash
cd ansible-k3s
ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt setup_sms_bridge_k3s.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

The cleanup is now complete! The project structure is clean, organized, and follows best practices with no code duplication.
