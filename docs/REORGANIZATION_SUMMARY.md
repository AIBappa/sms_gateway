# Project Reorganization Summary

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Separate Deployment Folders
- **ansible-docker/** - Contains Docker-based deployment files
- **ansible-k3s/** - Contains K3s-based deployment files

### 2. Moved Deployment-Specific Files

#### ansible-docker/
- `setup_sms_bridge.yml` - Main Docker deployment
- `restart_sms_bridge.yml` - Restart Docker containers
- `stop_sms_bridge.yml` - Stop Docker containers
- `inventory.txt` - Ansible inventory
- `README.md` - Docker deployment documentation

#### ansible-k3s/
- `setup_sms_bridge_k3s.yml` - Main K3s deployment
- `restart_sms_bridge_k3s.yml` - Restart K3s services
- `stop_sms_bridge_k3s.yml` - Stop K3s services
- `uninstall_k3s.yml` - Remove K3s completely
- `inventory.txt` - Ansible inventory
- `README.md` - K3s deployment documentation

### 3. Kept Shared Files in Root Directory
- `vault.yml` - Encrypted secrets (shared by both deployments)
- `schema.sql` - Database schema (shared by both deployments)
- `sms_server.py` - Main application code (shared by both deployments)
- `checks/` - Validation modules directory (shared by both deployments)
- `docs/` - Documentation directory
- `tests/` - Testing utilities directory

### 4. Updated Path References
All playbooks now reference shared files using relative paths:
- `../vault.yml` instead of `vault.yml`
- `../schema.sql` instead of `./schema.sql`
- `../sms_server.py` instead of `./sms_server.py`
- `../checks/` instead of `./checks/`

### 5. Created Documentation
- Updated main `README.md` with new project structure
- Created `ansible-docker/README.md` for Docker deployment
- Created `ansible-k3s/README.md` for K3s deployment

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits Achieved

### No Code Duplication
- Single source of truth for application code
- Shared configuration files
- Easier maintenance and updates

### Clear Separation of Concerns
- Docker deployment isolated in its own folder
- K3s deployment isolated in its own folder
- Shared resources clearly identified

### Better Organization
- Easy to choose between deployment methods
- Clear documentation for each approach
- Consistent file structure

### Path Efficiency
- Relative path references prevent code duplication
- Changes to shared files automatically apply to both deployments
- No risk of inconsistencies between deployment methods

## ðŸš€ Usage Instructions

### For Docker Deployment:
```bash
cd ansible-docker
ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt setup_sms_bridge.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

### For K3s Deployment:
```bash
cd ansible-k3s
ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt setup_sms_bridge_k3s.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

### File Structure
```

```

## âœ… Verification Checklist

- [x] No duplicate files between deployment folders
- [x] All path references updated to use relative paths
- [x] Both deployment methods can access shared files
- [x] Documentation created for both deployment methods
- [x] Main README updated with new structure
- [x] File organization is logical and maintainable
- [x] **Obsolete files removed from main directory**

## ðŸ§¹ Cleanup Completed

### Removed Files from Main Directory:
- `restart_sms_bridge.yml` â†’ moved to `ansible-docker/`
- `restart_sms_bridge_k3s.yml` â†’ moved to `ansible-k3s/`
- `setup_sms_bridge.yml` â†’ moved to `ansible-docker/`
- `setup_sms_bridge_k3s.yml` â†’ moved to `ansible-k3s/`
- `stop_sms_bridge.yml` â†’ moved to `ansible-docker/`
- `stop_sms_bridge_k3s.yml` â†’ moved to `ansible-k3s/`
- `uninstall_k3s.yml` â†’ moved to `ansible-k3s/`
- `inventory.txt` â†’ duplicated in both deployment folders
- `README_K3S.md` â†’ replaced by deployment-specific READMEs

The project is now properly organized with no code duplication and clear separation between deployment methods!
